## General Data Visualization Standards - Chart Elements for Reports 

### Principle

Make it easy for readers to process the key information in charts by drawing their eyes to key information. Reduce visual clutter and embrace whitespace. Remove redundant elements like title axes, labels, and text if the information is already conveyed elsewhere in the graph or accompanying text.

### Elements

#### 1. Figure Number
The figure number appears above the figure title so users can easily match content discussed in the narrative text and the graph. *Recommended*   

#### 2. Title

The title should be short but give a clear idea of what the chart is about - answer the three questions “what”, “where” and “when”. *Recommended*

#### 3.	Sub title
The subtitle provides additional technical information to the reader (statistical measure, units, time periods, geographical coverage) that is not contained in the title.  The subtitle can be more lengthy than the title but should also be as short as possible. *Optional*

#### 4.	Legend
The legend should identify the symbols, patterns or colors used to represent the data in the chart. The legend should not be displayed when only one series of values is represented in the chart. *Recommended if color scales are used to differentiate categories*

#### 5.	Data Labels
Data labels are applied directly to elements inside of a visualization to show the value of a datapoint or the category of the data.  If the chart is accompanied by a table containing the same information, considering removing data labels. *Optional*

#### 6.	Axis Labels/Axis Text/Axis Grids
The axis titles should identify/assist in the interpretation of the values displayed in the chart. You do not need to include an axis components when the unit of measure is obvious (e.g. “years” for time series) and when the reader can easily interpret the graph from information contained elsewhere.* Optional*

#### 7.	Footnote
A footnote may be used to provide definitions or methodological information or caveats or limitations that are important to associate the graphic for proper interpretation. *Optional*

#### 8.	Source
The data source is an important element as many graphs are copied from their original source and are published without attribution or reference. Often WFP is not the sole owner of the data and multiple partners can claim ownership to the data.  Rather than the organization (WFP, the source field could reference the data collection exercise (i.e. Mali Emergency Food Security Assessment, April 2022). *Recommended*
